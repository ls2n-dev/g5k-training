# Grid5000 Training Courses

Grid'5000 is a large-scale and flexible testbed research infrastructure for experiment-driven research studies in all areas of computer science, with a focus on parallel and distributed computing including Cloud, HPC and Big Data and AI.

This infrastructure consists of around 1000 machines spread over 11 sites, interconnected by a dedicated 10 Gbit/s network which can be isolated from the Internet for experiments. It allows research teams to configure a network with specific characteristics and to deploy a specific software stack on any or all of the nodes for the duration of an experiment. Reserving bare nodes (bare-metal), Grid'5000 users can deploy any operating system on a wide variety of nodes.
