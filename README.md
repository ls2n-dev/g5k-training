# Grid5000 Training Courses

Grid'5000 is a large-scale and flexible testbed research infrastructure for experiment-driven research studies in all areas of computer science, with a focus on parallel and distributed computing including Cloud, HPC and Big Data and AI.

This infrastructure consists of around 1000 machines spread over 11 sites, interconnected by a dedicated 10 Gbit/s network which can be isolated from the Internet for experiments. It allows research teams to configure a network with specific characteristics and to deploy a specific software stack on any or all of the nodes for the duration of an experiment. Reserving bare nodes (bare-metal), Grid'5000 users can deploy any operating system on a wide variety of nodes.

## Course description

This Comprehensive LS2N Dev Lab Class on *Fundamentals of Grid'5000* will help you to learn from scratch how to use Grid'5000 resources and manage your experiment-driven deployments on a large-scale and flexible testbed research infrastructure for your project research studies in all areas of computer science and their direct applications.
 
## What you'll learn

We'll answer common questions like:
- What is Grid'5000 and how does it apply to technical projects?
- How can Grid'5000 help me to develop my experiment-driven research studies ?
- What is the difference between Grid'5000 and public or academic cloud resources services ?

And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Apply Design Thinking to technical projects to enable more creative and innovative solutions.
- Relate the five phases of Design Thinking to the Agile Software Development framework.
- Leverage the core principles and key phases of Design Thinking to envision and define more meaningful solutions.
