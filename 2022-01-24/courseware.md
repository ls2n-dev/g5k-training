## What you'll learn 
We'll answer common questions like:
- What is Grid'5000 and how does it apply to technical projects?
- How can Grid'5000 help me to develop my experiment-driven research studies?
- What is the difference between Grid'5000 and public or academic cloud resources services?

And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Use and manage Grid'5000 resources for your technical projects.
- Leverage the core principles and key phases of Grid'5000 to envision and define more meaningful solutions.
- Understand concepts, rules and procedures on Grid'5000.

:::info
💡 Grid'5000 is a scientific instrument supporting experiment-driven research in all areas of computer science, with a focus on distributed computing, cloud computing, high performance computing, big data and networking. **Its use should lead to scientific results or contribute to education in this area.**

## Some glossary
- `site`: set of clusters located in the same location (*room/building/campus*) somewhere in France
    - at Nantes, clusters are [hosted at IMT Atlantique](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Nantes:Home)
- `cluster`: homogeneous set of nodes per site ([clusters in Nantes](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Nantes:Hardware))
- `nodes/server`: compute resources, you can reserve a slice of it (e.g. 1 core) or all the whole node to run a computation
- `scheduler`: program that decides on the placement of the user program on nodes. Grid'5000 uses [OAR](http://oar.imag.fr/docs/latest/) (other such grids use SLURM, SGE ...).
    - There's one scheduler per site
- `job`: unit of scheduling. 
    - A job has a lot of parameters that can influence its placement on the platform.

- `frontend`: Machine from which you can interact with a scheduler. 
    - There's as many frontends as sites.

## Overview of control and monitoring tools
