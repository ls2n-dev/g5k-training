## What you'll learn 
We'll answer common questions like:
- What is Grid'5000 and how does it apply to technical projects?
- How can Grid'5000 help me to develop my experiment-driven research studies?
- What is the difference between Grid'5000 and public or academic cloud resources services?

And when you're done you'll be able to:
- Use and manage Grid'5000 resources with basics tools/apps for your technical projects.
- Leverage the core principles and key phases of Grid'5000 to envision and define more meaningful solutions.
- Understand concepts, rules and procedures on Grid'5000.

:::info
:point_up: Grid'5000 is a scientific instrument supporting experiment-driven research in all areas of **computer science**, with a focus on distributed computing, cloud computing, high performance computing, big data and networking. **Its use should lead to scientific results or contribute to education in this area.**

## Some glossary
- **site**: set of clusters located in the same location (*room/building/campus*) somewhere in France. Nantes site web page: https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Nantes:Home <br>
![](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/images/Renater5-g5k.jpg)
- **cluster**: homogeneous set of nodes per site.
    - 2 clusters are [hosted in Nantes at IMT Atlantique](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/Nantes:Hardware)
- **node/server**: compute resources, you can reserve a slice of it (e.g. 1 core) or all the whole node to run a computation
- **scheduler**: program that decides on the placement of the user program on nodes. Grid'5000 uses [OAR](http://oar.imag.fr/docs/latest/) (other such grids use SLURM, SGE ...).
    - There's one scheduler per site
- **job**: unit of scheduling. 
    - A job has a lot of parameters that can influence its placement on the platform.
    - A job scheduling is the process of allocating system resources to many different tasks by an operating system or a infra manager (per site). This type of scheduling makes sure that all jobs are carried out fairly and on time. 
- **frontend**: there are 2 types of frontends
    - those accessible from internet into Grid5000 intranet, we call here *access frontend* (or *proxy*). They are only round-robin alias servers hosted and distributed today on 2 sites. We cannot use *scheduler*.
    - those accessible only from inside Grid5000 intranet and where we can interact with a scheduler; these servers are called *site frontend*
