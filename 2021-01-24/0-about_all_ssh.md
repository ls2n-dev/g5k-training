## Generate a new ssh key pair
```bash
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/path/to/your/.ssh/id_rsa): /path/where/you/want/to/save/your/id_rsa
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /path/where/you/want/to/save/your/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /path/where/you/want/to/save/your/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:m34zcBpL5og96ViEujre+xxxxxxxxxxBVv151OtzrOM 
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+
