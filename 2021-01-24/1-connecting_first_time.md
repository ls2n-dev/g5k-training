# Connecting for the first time on G5K

The primary way to move around Grid'5000 is using SSH. A [reference page on SSH](https://www.grid5000.fr/w/SSH) is updated and maintained with advanced configuration options that frequent users will find useful.

As described in the figure above, when using Grid'5000, you will typically:
- [connect, using SSH, to an access machine](#connection-by-ssh)
- connect from this access machine to a site frontend
- on this site frontend, reserve resources (nodes), and connect to those nodes

## Connection by SSH

### SSH connection through a web interface

If you want an out-of-the-box solution which does not require you to setup SSH, you can connect through a web interface. The interface is available at https://intranet.grid5000.fr/shell/SITE/. 

For example, to access nantes's site, use: https://intranet.grid5000.fr/shell/nantes/ (DO NOT FORGET THE '/' caracter at the end). To connect you will have to type in your credentials twice (first for the HTTP proxy, then for the SSH connection).

### Connecting to a Grid'5000 frontal access machine

To enter the Grid'5000 network from Internet, one must use an access machine: `access.grid5000.fr` . For all connections, you must use the login that was provided to you when you created your Grid'5000 account.

```bash
outside% ssh <login>@access.grid5000.fr
```

You will get authenticated using the SSH public key you provided in the account creation form. Password authentication is disabled.

You can modify your SSH keys in the [account management interface](https://api.grid5000.fr/stable/users/).

### Connecting to a Grid'5000 site access machine

Now you are connected inside one of the G5K frontal access node (`access-north` or `access-south`), you can now reach to one the Grid'5000 sites. As you know the G5k platform is structured into sites (Grenoble, Rennes, Nancy, Nantes ...). Each site hosts one or more clusters (homogeneous sets of machines, usually bought at the same time). As you can see below:

![g5k sites](https://www.grid5000.fr/mediawiki/images/Renater5-g5k.jpg)

To connect to a particular site, you just do the following SSH connection.

```bash
access-north% ssh <site>
...
<login>@f<site> ~ %
```

#### Tips : ssh config file with proxycommand
Configure SSH aliases using the `ProxyCommand` option. Using this, you can avoid the two-hops connection (access machine, then frontend) but establish connections directly to frontends. This requires using OpenSSH, which is the SSH software available on all GNU/Linux systems, MacOS, and also recent versions of Microsoft Windows.

Add or append these following line in your `.ssh/config` (UNIX) or `\Program Files\Git\etc\ssh\ssh_config` (WINDOWS)
```bash
Host g5k
  User login
  Hostname access.grid5000.fr
  ForwardAgent no

Host *.g5k
  User login
  ProxyCommand ssh g5k -W "$(basename %h .g5k):%p"
  ForwardAgent no
```
> Reminder: `login` here is your Grid'5000 username.

> Warning: the `ProxyCommand` line works if your login shell is `bash`. If not you may have to adapt it. For instance, for the fish shell, this line must look like this `ProxyCommand ssh g5k -W (basename %h .g5k):%p`.

Once done, you can establish connections to any machine (first of all: frontends) inside Grid'5000 directly, just by suffixing `.g5k` to its hostname (instead of first having to connect to an access machine). E.g.: to connect directly to the `nantes` from outside, just do:

```bash
outside% ssh nantes.gtk
<login>@fnantes ~ %
```
